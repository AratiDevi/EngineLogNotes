Element.getElementsByTagName is similar to Document.getElementsByTagName(), except that its search is restricted to those elements which are descendants of the specified element.

Syntax
-------

elements = element.getElementsByTagName(tagName)
elements is a live HTMLCollection of found elements in the order they appear in the sub-tree. If no elements were found, the HTMLCollection is empty.
element is the element from where the search should start. Note that only the descendants of this element are included in the search, but not the element itself.
tagName is the qualified name to look for. The special string "*" represents all elements. For compatibility with XHTML, lower-case should be used.



Example
-------


// check the alignment on a number of cells in a table. 

var table = document.getElementById("forecast-table"); 

var cells = table.getElementsByTagName("td"); 

for (var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) { 

    var status = cells[i].getAttribute("data-status"); 

    if ( status == "open" ) { 

        // grab the data 

    }
}
